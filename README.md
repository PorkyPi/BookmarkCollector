# BookmarkCollector
This is graduate project app which I made for the final lesson in the Bionic University. 

The main idea to saving some intresting HTTP links for future reading. The app have catalogs for comfortable store data and some attributes like "mark of read", date when it saved, and graduation an interest of future reading. An interfase allows add and change catalogs and bookmarks.
